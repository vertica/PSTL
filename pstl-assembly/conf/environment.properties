# PSTL Job Environment Variables
# =============================================================================
#
# Environment variables provided here, in the form KEY=VALUE will be available
# to all jobs at runtime. Jobs may override a specific environment variable by
# providing their own environment.properties.
#
# Typical use cases will define environment variables here for environment
# specific variables which need to be referenced in a job definition in SQL.
# Referencing the variable results in being able to use the same exact job
# definition across multiple environments such as: dev, qa, stage, prod.
#
# An example job definition may look like:
#
# CREATE STREAM foo
# FROM KAFKA
# OPTIONS(
#   'kafka.bootstrap.servers'='${env:KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS}'
# );
