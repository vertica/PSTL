# PSTL Spark Configuration
# =============================================================================
#
# Spark settings provided here, in the form KEY=VALUE will be available to all
# all jobs at runtime. Jobs may override specific spark settings by providing
# their own spark.properties.
#
# $SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf can still be used for system-wide defaults if you are
# more comfortable keeping everything in one place. However, take note of required PSTL config
# keys and carry them forward in to $SPARK_HOME/conf/spark-defaults.conf.
